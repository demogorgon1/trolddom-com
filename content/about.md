Trolddom is an old school 2D MMORPG set in a classic fantasy world full of monsters, classes, quests, loot, and a ton of other stuff. 

It is currently under development, but will soon be available on Steam as Early Access. 

Parts of the game are [released as open source](https://github.com/demogorgon1/trolddom-public), making it possible for players to contribute new content if they're so inclined.
