A Trolddom demo is going to be available for free during upcoming Steam Next Fest. Or, wait, it's actually already available! Head over to the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506440/Trolddom/), download the demo and give it a try. 

The full (Early Access) game will be released at the end of this month. Characters you create in the demo will carry over to the full game, so this is a chance to get a head start.
